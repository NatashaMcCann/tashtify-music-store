# This function lists all the Album Names in the music store. It iterates over each album in the store and returns each
# album name on a new line.

# This function adds an album into the music store. It firstly asks for two inputs from the end user. The album name,
# which prompts the user to enter the name of the artist, followed by the album by the artist. This then appends a dictionary
# to the list of albums with each result of the input function assigned using a variable

# poss room for a bit of refactoring.
# This function updates a pre existing album in the music store. It firstly asks for an input from the end user assigned to a variable
# album name to find. This asks the user for the album they would like to update. An iteration of Album Name is then assigned to a variable
# album names which iterates over each album in the albums list of dictionaries, specifically hitting the album name.
# We then have an if else statement that checks that that album exists in the list. If it does exist, the position variable indexes within
# the album name variable with the result of the input function album name to find and finds the position of the input in the list.
# It then deletes the album at that position. There are then two further input functions, one that makes the update to the album and the other to the artist.
# It then appends the result of each input into a new dictionary.
# NEED TO FIND A WAY TO ONLY REPLACE ALBUM NAME, BUT UNSURE HOW TO DO THIS IN A LIST OF DICTIONARIES OR WHETHER ITS EVEN POSSIBLE

# This function deletes an album from albums. It firstly takes an input asking the end user which album they would like to delete
# it then iterates over each album in albums, specifying the album name key. If the inputted result is in album names which is the iteration,
# it finds the position of the album (dictionary) in the list and removes it. If it doesnt exist, it prints album is not in the list.

#Â This function lists each album by an artist. It firstly takes an input asking the end user for the name of the artist.
# It then iterates over each album in albums looking for the Artist key. This is assigned to a variable called album names.
# It then checks the value of artist matches up to the keys in albums. It will then return the function search albums, with artist
# passed in as the parameter. The search albums function essentially iterates over each album in albums again. Looks for the artist key
# in album and checks its equal to artist (checking that it exists). It then prints the album name from artist, so returns the album name
# associated with that artist in the dictionary.
